Cherushii is Chelsea Faith, an electronic musician based in San Francisco, California. Her passion for dance music history is evident in her work, which takes cues from Detroit techno, Chicago house, and classic rave sounds. A multi-instrumentalist since childhood, Chelsea began experimenting with electronics as a teenager, which lead to playing live techno and house at underground raves in the 2000s. She has been working as a live performer, producer, DJ, and remixer for over a decade, using her gear savvy and innate musicianship to create lush, retro-futurist productions. Cherushii signed with LA-based dance music tastemakers <a href="http://listentosilk.com/">100% Silk</a> in 2013, and released her second 12" for the label <a href="https://soundcloud.com/100percentsilk/cherushii-far-away-so-close">"Far Away So Close"</a> in November 2015.
