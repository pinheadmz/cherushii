Cherushii is Chelsea Faith, an electronic musician, composer, producer, and live performer based in San Francisco, California. Her passion for dance music history is evident in her work, which takes cues from Detroit techno, Chicago house, and classic rave sounds. A multi-instrumentalist since childhood, Chelsea began experimenting with electronics as a teenager, which lead her to begin playing live techno and house at underground raves in the 2000s. She has been working as a live PA, producer, and remixer for 10 years, using her gear savvy and innate musicianship to create lush, retro-futurist productions. Chelsea has releases on SubSensory Recordings and Nude Photo Music, and her debut EP as Cherushii, "Queen Of Cups" was released on <a href="http://listentosilk.com/">100% Silk</a> November 2013.
